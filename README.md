# embeddings
#### Overview of embedding systems and various use cases.

**Embeddings** are dense, low-dimensional representations of data (such as words, sentences, or even images) in a continuous vector space. Different types of embeddings are used depending on the task and the data being processed. Below are some of the most common types of embeddings, primarily focusing on text embeddings, but also extending to images and graphs.

**1. Static and Dynamic Embeddings:**
   Static embeddings and dynamic embeddings refer to different ways in which text (usually words or tokens) is transformed into vector representations. Their distinction comes from how the embeddings are generated and whether they change based on the context or remain fixed across all contexts. More on this:
